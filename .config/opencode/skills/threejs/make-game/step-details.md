# Step Details — Subagent Prompt Templates

This file contains the detailed subagent instructions for each pipeline step. The orchestrator in SKILL.md references these when launching `Task` subagents.

## Step 1: Scaffold the Game

### Main Thread — Infrastructure Setup

1. Locate the plugin's template directory. Check these paths in order until found:
   - The agent's plugin cache (e.g. `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-plugins/game-creator/1.0.0/templates/`)
   - The `templates/` directory relative to this plugin's install location
2. **Determine the target directory.** If the current working directory is the `game-creator` plugin repository (check for `CLAUDE.md` mentioning "game-creator" or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), create the game inside `examples/` (e.g., `examples/<game-name>/`). Otherwise, create it in the current working directory (`<game-name>/`).
3. Copy the entire template directory to the target:
   - 2D: copy `templates/phaser-2d/` -> `<target-dir>/`
   - 3D: copy `templates/threejs-3d/` -> `<target-dir>/`
3. Update `package.json` — set `"name"` to the game name
4. Update `<title>` in `index.html` to a human-readable version of the game name
5. **Verify Node.js/npm availability**: Run `node --version && npm --version` to confirm Node.js and npm are installed and accessible. If they fail (e.g., nvm lazy-loading), try sourcing nvm: `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"` then retry. If Node.js is not installed at all, tell the user they need to install it before continuing.
6. Run `npm install` in the new project directory
7. **Install Playwright and Chromium** — Playwright is required for runtime verification and the iterate loop:
   1. Check if Playwright is available: `npx playwright --version`
   2. If that fails, check `node_modules/.bin/playwright --version`
   3. If neither works, run `npm install -D @playwright/test` explicitly
   4. Then install the browser binary: `npx playwright install chromium`
   5. Verify success; if it fails, warn and continue (build verification still works, but runtime/iterate checks will be skipped)
8. **Verify template scripts exist** — The template ships with `scripts/verify-runtime.mjs`, `scripts/iterate-client.js`, and `scripts/example-actions.json`. Confirm they are present. The `verify` and `iterate` npm scripts are already in `package.json` from the template.
9. **Start the dev server** — Before running `npm run dev`, check if the configured port (in `vite.config.js`) is already in use: `lsof -i :<port> -t`. If occupied, update `vite.config.js` to use the next available port (try 3001, 3002, etc.). Then start the dev server in the background and confirm it responds. Keep it running throughout the pipeline. Note the actual port number — pass it to `scripts/verify-runtime.mjs` via the `PORT` env variable in subsequent runs.

### Subagent — Game Implementation

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 1 (Scaffold) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Game concept**: `<user's game description>`
> **Skill to load**: `phaser` and `game-architecture` (2D) or `threejs-game` and `game-architecture` (3D)
>
> **Core loop first** — implement in this order:
> 1. Input (touch + keyboard from the start — never keyboard-only)
> 2. Player movement / core mechanic
> 3. Fail condition (death, collision, timer)
> 4. Scoring
> 5. Restart flow (GameState.reset() -> clean slate)
>
> Keep scope small: **1 scene, 1 mechanic, 1 fail condition**. Wire spectacle EventBus hooks alongside the core loop — they are scaffolding, not polish.
>
> Transform the template into the game concept:
> - Rename entities, scenes/systems, and events to match the concept
> - Implement core gameplay mechanics
> - Wire up EventBus events, GameState fields, and Constants values
> - Ensure all modules communicate only through EventBus
> - All magic numbers go in Constants.js
> - **No title screen** — the template boots directly into gameplay. Do not create a MenuScene or title screen. Only add one if the user explicitly asks.
> - **No in-game score HUD** — the Play.fun widget displays score in a deadzone at the top of the game. Do not create a UIScene or HUD overlay for score display.
> - **Mobile-first input**: Choose the best mobile input scheme for the game concept (tap zones, virtual joystick, gyroscope tilt, swipe). Implement touch + keyboard from the start — never keyboard-only. Use the unified analog InputSystem pattern (moveX/moveZ) so game logic is input-source-agnostic.
> - **Force portrait for vertical games**: For dodgers, runners, collectors, and endless fallers, set `FORCE_PORTRAIT = true` in Constants.js. This locks portrait layout on desktop (pillarboxed with black bars via `Scale.FIT + CENTER_BOTH`). Use fixed design dimensions (540x960), not conditional `_isPortrait ? 540 : 960`.
> - **Visible touch indicators required**: Always render semi-transparent arrow buttons (or direction indicators) on touch-capable devices. Use capability detection (`('ontouchstart' in window) || (navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0)`), NOT OS detection (`device.os.android || device.os.iOS`). Enable pointer events (pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup) on ALL devices — never gate behind `isMobile`. Use `TOUCH` constants from Constants.js for sizing.
> - **Minimum 7-8% canvas width for collectibles/hazards**: Items smaller than 7% of `GAME.WIDTH` become unrecognizable blobs on phone screens. Size attacks at ~9%, power-ups at ~7%, player character at 12-15%.
> - Wire spectacle events: emit `SPECTACLE_ENTRANCE` in `create()`, `SPECTACLE_ACTION` on every player input, `SPECTACLE_HIT` on score/destroy, `SPECTACLE_COMBO` on consecutive hits (pass `{ combo }` ), `SPECTACLE_STREAK` at milestones (5, 10, 25 — pass `{ streak }`), `SPECTACLE_NEAR_MISS` on close calls
>
> **Visual identity — push the pose:**
> - If the player character represents a real person or brand, build visual recognition into the entity from the start. Don't use generic circles/rectangles as placeholders — use descriptive colors, proportions, and features that communicate identity even before pixel art is added.
> - Named opponents/NPCs must have visual presence on screen — never text-only. At minimum use distinct colored shapes that suggest the brand. Better: simple character forms with recognizable features.
> - Collectibles and hazards must be visually self-explanatory. Avoid abstract concepts ("imagination blocks", "creativity sparks"). Use concrete objects players instantly recognize (polaroids, trophies, lightning bolts, money bags, etc.).
> - Think: "Could someone screenshot this and immediately know what the game is about?"
> - **NEVER** use a single letter (C, G, O) as a character's visual identity
> - **NEVER** differentiate two characters only by fill color — they must have distinct silhouettes and features
> - When a company is featured (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, etc.), use the CEO as the character: Altman for OpenAI, Amodei for Anthropic, Musk for xAI, Zuckerberg for Meta, Nadella for Microsoft, Pichai for Google, Huang for NVIDIA
> - Add entrance sequence in `create()`: player starts off-screen, tweens into position with `Bounce.easeOut`, landing shake + particle burst
> - Add combo tracking to GameState: `combo` (current streak, resets on miss), `bestCombo` (session high), both reset in `reset()`
> - Ensure restart is clean — test mentally that 3 restarts in a row would work identically
> - Add `isMuted` to GameState for mute support
>
> **CRITICAL — Preserve the button pattern:**
> - The template's `GameOverScene.js` contains a working `createButton()` helper (Container + Graphics + Text). **Do NOT rewrite this method.** Keep it intact or copy it into any new scenes that need buttons. The correct z-order is: Graphics first (background), Text second (label), Container interactive. If you put Graphics on top of Text, the text becomes invisible. If you make the Graphics interactive instead of the Container, hover/press states break.
>
> **Character & entity sizing:**
> - Character WIDTH from `GAME.WIDTH * ratio`, HEIGHT from `WIDTH * SPRITE_ASPECT` (where `const SPRITE_ASPECT = 1.5` for 200x300 spritesheets). **Never** define character HEIGHT as `GAME.HEIGHT * ratio` — on mobile portrait, `GAME.HEIGHT` is much larger than `GAME.WIDTH`, squishing characters.
> - For character-driven games (named personalities, mascots, famous figures): make the main character prominent — `GAME.WIDTH * 0.12` to `GAME.WIDTH * 0.15` (12-15% of screen width). Use caricature proportions (large head = 40-50% of sprite height, exaggerate distinguishing features) for personality games.
> - Non-character entities (projectiles, collectibles, squares) can use `GAME.WIDTH * ratio` for both dimensions since they have no intrinsic aspect ratio to preserve.
>
> **Play.fun safe zone:**
> - Import `SAFE_ZONE` from `Constants.js`. All UI text, buttons, and interactive elements (title text, score panels, restart buttons) must be positioned below `SAFE_ZONE.TOP`. The Play.fun SDK renders a 75px widget bar at the top of the viewport (z-index 9999). Use `safeTop + usableH * ratio` for proportional positioning within the usable area (where `usableH = GAME.HEIGHT - SAFE_ZONE.TOP`).
>
> **Generate game-specific test actions:**
> After implementing the core loop, overwrite `scripts/example-actions.json` with actions tailored to this game. Requirements:
> - Use the game's actual input keys (e.g., ArrowLeft/ArrowRight for dodger, space for flappy, w/a/s/d for top-down)
> - Include enough gameplay to score at least 1 point
> - Include a long idle period (60+ frames with no input) to let the fail condition trigger
> - Total should be at least 150 frames of gameplay
>
> Example for a dodge game (arrow keys):
> ```json
> [
>   {"buttons":["ArrowRight"],"frames":20},
>   {"buttons":["ArrowLeft"],"frames":20},
>   {"buttons":["ArrowRight"],"frames":15},
>   {"buttons":[],"frames":10},
>   {"buttons":["ArrowLeft"],"frames":20},
>   {"buttons":[],"frames":80}
> ]
> ```
>
> Example for a platformer (space to jump):
> ```json
> [
>   {"buttons":["space"],"frames":4},
>   {"buttons":[],"frames":25},
>   {"buttons":["space"],"frames":4},
>   {"buttons":[],"frames":25},
>   {"buttons":["space"],"frames":4},
>   {"buttons":[],"frames":80}
> ]
> ```
>
> Before returning, write `<project-dir>/design-brief.md`:
> ```
> # Design Brief
> ## Concept
> One-line game concept.
> ## Core Mechanics
> For each mechanic:
> - **Name**: what it does
> - **State field**: which GameState field it affects
> - **Expected magnitude**: how much/fast it should change (e.g., "reaches 50-70% of max within the round duration without player input")
> ## Win/Lose Conditions
> - How the player wins
> - How the player loses
> - Confirm both outcomes are realistically achievable with the current Constants.js values
> ## Entity Interactions
> For each visible entity (enemies, projectiles, collectibles, environmental objects):
> - **Name**: what it is
> - **Visual identity**: what it should LOOK like and why (reference real logos, people, objects — not abstract concepts)
> - **Distinguishing feature**: the ONE exaggerated feature visible at thumbnail size (e.g., "curly dark hair + glasses" for Amodei, "leather jacket" for Jensen Huang)
> - **Real image asset**: logo URL to download, or "pixel art" if no real image applies
> - **Behavior**: what it does (moves, falls, spawns, etc.)
> - **Player interaction**: how the player interacts with it (dodge, collect, tap, block, or "none — background/decoration")
> - **AI/opponent interaction**: how the opponent interacts with it, if applicable
>
> For named people: describe hair, glasses, facial hair, clothing. For companies: specify logo to download. NEVER use a letter or text label as visual identity.
>
> ## Expression Map
>
> For each personality character, map game events to expressions:
>
> ### Player: [Name]
> | Game Event | Expression | Why |
> |---|---|---|
> | Idle/default | normal | Resting state |
> | Score point / collect item | happy | Positive reinforcement |
> | Take damage / lose life | angry | Visceral reaction |
> | Power-up / special event | surprised | Excitement |
> | Win / game over (high score) | happy | Celebration |
> | Lose / game over (low score) | angry | Defeat |
>
> ### Opponent: [Name]
> | Game Event | Expression | Why |
> |---|---|---|
> | Idle/default | normal | Resting state |
> | Player scores | angry | Frustrated at losing |
> | Opponent scores | happy | Gloating |
> | Near-miss / close call | surprised | Tension |
> ```
>
> Do NOT start a dev server or run builds — the orchestrator handles that.

### After Subagent Returns

Run the Verification Protocol (see verification-protocol.md).

**Create `progress.md`** at the game's project root. Read the game's actual source files to populate it accurately:
- Read `src/core/EventBus.js` for the event list
- Read `src/core/Constants.js` for the key sections (GAME, PLAYER, ENEMY, etc.)
- List files in `src/entities/` for entity names
- Read `src/core/GameState.js` for state fields

Write `progress.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Progress

## Game Concept
- **Name**: [game name from project]
- **Engine**: Phaser 3 / Three.js
- **Description**: [from user's original prompt]

## Step 1: Scaffold
- **Entities**: [list entity names from src/entities/]
- **Events**: [list event names from EventBus.js]
- **Constants keys**: [top-level sections from Constants.js, e.g. GAME, PLAYER, ENEMY, COLORS]
- **Scoring system**: [how points are earned, from GameState + scene logic]
- **Fail condition**: [what ends the game]
- **Input scheme**: [keyboard/mouse/touch controls implemented]

## Decisions / Known Issues
- [any notable decisions or issues from scaffolding]
```

**Tell the user:**
> Your game is scaffolded and running! Here's how it's organized:
> - `src/core/Constants.js` — all game settings (speed, colors, sizes)
> - `src/core/EventBus.js` — how parts of the game talk to each other
> - `src/core/GameState.js` — tracks score, lives, etc.
> - **Mobile controls are built in** — works on phone (touch/tilt) and desktop (keyboard)
>
> **Next up: pixel art.** I'll create custom pixel art sprites for every character, enemy, item, and background tile — all generated as code, no image files needed. Then I'll add visual polish on top.

Mark task 1 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Step 1.5: Add Game Assets

**Always run this step for both 2D and 3D games.** 2D games get pixel art sprites; 3D games get GLB models and animated characters.

Mark task 2 as `in_progress`.

### Pre-step: Character Library Check

Before launching the asset subagent, check if the game uses personality characters. For each personality, resolve their sprites using this **tiered fallback** (try each tier in order, stop at the first success):

**1. Read `design-brief.md`** to identify personality characters and their slugs.

**2. Resolve the character library path** — find `assets/characters/manifest.json` relative to the plugin root:
   - Check `assets/characters/manifest.json` relative to the plugin install directory
   - Check common plugin cache paths (e.g., `~/.claude/plugins/cache/local-plugins/game-creator/*/assets/characters/`)

**3. For each personality, try these tiers in order:**

**Tier 1 — Pre-built (best)**: Check if slug exists in `manifest.json`. If yes, copy sprites:
```bash
mkdir -p <project-dir>/public/assets/characters/<slug>/
cp <plugin-root>/assets/characters/characters/<slug>/sprites/* \
   <project-dir>/public/assets/characters/<slug>/
```
Result: 4-expression spritesheet ready. Done.

**Tier 2 — Build from 4 images (good)**: WebSearch for 4 expression photos. **Any photo format works** (jpg, png, webp) — the pipeline has ML background removal built in, so transparent PNGs are NOT required. Search broadly:
- normal: `"<Name> portrait photo"` or `"<Name> face"` — neutral expression
- happy: `"<Name> smiling"` or `"<Name> laughing"`
- angry: `"<Name> angry"` or `"<Name> serious stern"`
- surprised: `"<Name> surprised"` or `"<Name> shocked"`

Prefer real photographs (not illustrations/cartoons). Head shots and half-body shots both work — `crop-head.mjs` uses face detection to isolate the face automatically. Download as `normal.jpg`, `happy.jpg`, etc. (any image extension).

If all 4 found, download to `<project-dir>/public/assets/characters/<slug>/raw/` and run:
```bash
node <plugin-root>/scripts/build-character.mjs "<Name>" \
  <project-dir>/public/assets/characters/<slug>/ --skip-find
```
Result: 4-expression spritesheet. Done.

**Tier 3 — Build from 1-3 images (acceptable)**: If WebSearch only finds 1-3 usable images:
- Download whatever was found to `raw/` (e.g., only `normal.png` and `happy.png`)
- **Duplicate the best image** (prefer normal) into the missing expression slots:
  ```bash
  cp raw/normal.png raw/angry.png    # fill missing with normal
  cp raw/normal.png raw/surprised.png
  ```
- Run `build-character.mjs` as above — all 4 raw slots are filled, pipeline produces a 4-frame spritesheet
- Result: 4-frame spritesheet where some expressions share the same face. Functional — the expression system still works, just with less visual variety.

**Tier 4 — Single image fallback (minimum)**: If WebSearch finds exactly 1 image OR the pipeline fails on some images:
- Use the single successful image for all 4 expression slots
- Run `build-character.mjs` — produces a spritesheet where all 4 frames are identical
- Result: Character is recognizable but has no expression changes. Still photo-composite, still works with the expression wiring (just no visible change).

**Tier 5 — Generative pixel art (worst case)**: If NO images can be found or the ENTIRE pipeline fails (bg removal crash, face detection fails on all images, network errors):
- Fall back to the **Personality Character (Caricature) archetype** from the `game-assets` skill — 32x48 pixel art grid at scale 4
- Note in `progress.md`: `"<Name>: pixel art fallback — no photo-composite available"`
- The subagent will create pixel art with recognizable features (hair, glasses, clothing) per the game-assets sprite design rules
- Result: No photo-composite, but the character is still visually distinct via pixel art caricature.

**4. Record results** for each character in `progress.md`:
```
## Characters
- trump: Tier 1 (pre-built, 4 expressions)
- karpathy: Tier 3 (1 image found, duplicated to 4 slots)
- some-ceo: Tier 5 (pixel art fallback)
```

**5. Pass to subagent**: the list of character slugs, which tier each resolved to, and how many unique expressions each has. The subagent needs this to know whether to wire full expression changes or skip expression logic for Tier 5 characters.

### 2D Subagent (Phaser 3)

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 1.5 (Pixel Art Sprites) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: 2D (Phaser 3)
> **Skill to load**: `game-assets`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** at the project root before starting. It describes the game's entities, events, constants, and scoring system from Step 1.
>
> **Character library sprites are already copied** to `public/assets/characters/<slug>/`. For personality characters, load the spritesheet and wire expression changes per the game-assets skill's "Expression Wiring Pattern". Add `EXPRESSION` and `EXPRESSION_HOLD_MS` to Constants.js. Wire expression changes to EventBus events per the Expression Map in `design-brief.md`.
>
> Follow the game-assets skill fully for non-personality entities:
> 1. Read all entity files (`src/entities/`) to find `generateTexture()` / `fillCircle()` calls
> 2. Choose the palette that matches the game's theme (DARK, BRIGHT, or RETRO)
> 3. Create `src/core/PixelRenderer.js` — the `renderPixelArt()` + `renderSpriteSheet()` utilities
> 4. Create `src/sprites/palette.js` with the chosen palette
> 5. Create sprite data files (`player.js`, `enemies.js`, `items.js`, `projectiles.js`) with pixel matrices
> 6. Create `src/sprites/tiles.js` with background tiles (ground variants, decorative elements)
> 7. Create or update the background system to use tiled pixel art instead of flat colors/grids
> 8. Update entity constructors to use pixel art instead of geometric shapes
> 9. Add Phaser animations for entities with multiple frames
> 10. Adjust physics bodies for new sprite dimensions
>
> **Character prominence**: If the game features a real person or named personality, use the Personality Character (Caricature) archetype — 32x48 grid at scale 4 (renders to 128x192px, ~35% of canvas height). The character must be the visually dominant element on screen. Supporting entities stay at Medium (16x16) or Small (12x12) to create clear visual hierarchy.
>
> **Push the pose — thematic expressiveness:**
> - Sprites must visually embody who/what they represent. A sprite for "Grok AI" should look like Grok (logo features, brand colors, xAI aesthetic) — not a generic robot or colored circle.
> - For real people: exaggerate their most recognizable features (signature hairstyle, glasses, facial hair, clothing). Recognition IS the meme hook.
> - For brands/products: incorporate logo shapes, brand colors, and distinctive visual elements into the sprite design.
> - For game objects: make them instantly recognizable. A "power-up" should look like the specific thing it represents in the theme, not a generic star or diamond.
> - Opponents should be visually distinct from each other — different colors, shapes, sizes, and personality. A player should tell them apart at a glance.
>
> **Self-audit before returning** — check every personality sprite against these:
> - Does each sprite have distinct hair (not a solid-color dome)?
> - Does each sprite have facial features beyond just eyes (glasses, facial hair, or clothing details if applicable)?
> - Would two character sprites look different if rendered in the same color?
> - Is any `scene.add.text()` being used as the primary identifier? If so, remove it and add physical features instead.
> - Does the head region (rows 0-28) use at least 4 distinct palette indices?
> - For brand entities: was a real logo downloaded and loaded? If not, why?
>
> **After completing your work**, append a `## Step 1.5: Assets` section to `progress.md` with: palette used, sprites created, any dimension changes to entities.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After 2D subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

### 3D Asset Flow (Three.js games)

For 3D games, generate custom models with Meshy AI and integrate them as animated characters and world props. This is the 3D parallel of the 2D pixel art step above.

**Pre-step: Environment Generation (World Labs — conditional)**

If `WLT_API_KEY` is set in the environment, generate a photorealistic 3D environment BEFORE character/asset generation:

1. **Ask the user for a reference image** (concept art, photo, screenshot). Image mode produces dramatically better results than text.
2. **Generate the environment:**
   ```bash
   WLT_API_KEY=<key> node <plugin-root>/scripts/worldlabs-generate.mjs \
     --mode image --image "<path-or-url>" \
     --prompt "a <environment matching game concept>" \
     --output <project-dir>/public/assets/environment/
   # Or text-only if no image:
   WLT_API_KEY=<key> node <plugin-root>/scripts/worldlabs-generate.mjs \
     --mode text \
     --prompt "a <detailed environment description matching game concept>" \
     --output <project-dir>/public/assets/environment/
   ```
3. **Download outputs** — the script produces: SPZ (Gaussian Splat), collider mesh (GLB), panorama, thumbnail. Copy all to `public/assets/environment/`.
4. **Record in `progress.md`:**
   ```
   ## 3D Environment
   - Source: World Labs (image/text mode)
   - Files: environment.spz, collider.glb
   - Prompt: "<prompt used>"
   ```

If `WLT_API_KEY` is NOT set, skip environment generation silently — the 3D subagent will use basic geometry/primitives as before.

**Pre-step: Character & Asset Generation**

The Meshy API key should already be obtained in Step 0. If not set, ask now (see Step 0 instructions).

1. **Read `design-brief.md`** to identify all characters (player + opponents/NPCs) and their names/descriptions.

2. **For EACH humanoid character, run the full generate->rig pipeline as ONE atomic step:**

**Tier 1 — Generate + Rig with Meshy AI** (preferred): This is a TWO-command chain — always run BOTH for humanoid characters. The rig step auto-downloads walk/run animation GLBs.
```bash
# Step A: Generate the character model
MESHY_API_KEY=<key> node <plugin-root>/scripts/meshy-generate.mjs \
  --mode text-to-3d \
  --prompt "a stylized <character description>, low poly game character, full body" \
  --polycount 15000 --pbr \
  --output <project-dir>/public/assets/models/ --slug <character-slug>

# Step B: Read the refineTaskId from meta, then rig immediately
# The rig command auto-downloads walk/run GLBs as <slug>-walk.glb and <slug>-run.glb
REFINE_ID=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('<project-dir>/public/assets/models/<character-slug>.meta.json'))['refineTaskId'])")
MESHY_API_KEY=<key> node <plugin-root>/scripts/meshy-generate.mjs \
  --mode rig --task-id $REFINE_ID --height 1.7 \
  --output <project-dir>/public/assets/models/ --slug <character-slug>
```

After this completes you have 3 files per character:
- `<slug>.glb` — rigged model with skeleton (use `loadAnimatedModel()` + `SkeletonUtils.clone()`)
- `<slug>-walk.glb` — walking animation (auto-downloaded)
- `<slug>-run.glb` — running animation (auto-downloaded)

**NEVER generate humanoid characters without rigging.** Static models require hacky programmatic animation that looks artificial.

For named personalities, be specific: `"a cartoon caricature of Trump, blonde hair, suit, red tie, low poly game character, full body"`.

For multiple characters, generate each with a distinct description for visual variety. Run generate->rig in parallel for different characters to save time.

**Tier 2 — Pre-built in `assets/3d-characters/`** (Meshy unavailable): Check `manifest.json` for a name/theme match. Copy the GLB:
```bash
cp <plugin-root>/assets/3d-characters/models/<model>.glb \
   <project-dir>/public/assets/models/<slug>.glb
```

**Tier 3 — Search Sketchfab**: Use `find-3d-asset.mjs` to search for a matching animated model:
```bash
node <plugin-root>/scripts/find-3d-asset.mjs \
  --query "<character name> animated character" \
  --max-faces 10000 --list-only
```

**Tier 4 — Generic library fallback**: Use the best match from `assets/3d-characters/`:
- **Soldier** — action/military/default human
- **Xbot** — sci-fi/tech/futuristic
- **RobotExpressive** — cartoon/casual/fun (most animations)
- **Fox** — nature/animal

When 2+ characters fall back to library, use different models to differentiate them.

**3. Generate / search for world objects** — Read `design-brief.md` entity list:
```bash
# With Meshy (preferred) — generate each prop
MESHY_API_KEY=<key> node <plugin-root>/scripts/meshy-generate.mjs \
  --mode text-to-3d \
  --prompt "a <entity description>, low poly game asset" \
  --polycount 5000 \
  --output <project-dir>/public/assets/models/ --slug <entity-slug>

# Without Meshy — search free libraries
node <plugin-root>/scripts/find-3d-asset.mjs --query "<entity description>" \
  --source polyhaven --output <project-dir>/public/assets/models/
```

**4. Record results** in `progress.md`:
```
## 3D Characters
- knight (player): Tier 1 — Meshy AI generated + rigged (idle/walk/run)
- goblin (enemy): Tier 1 — Meshy AI generated + rigged (idle/walk/run)

## 3D Assets
- tree: Meshy AI generated (static prop)
- barrel: Meshy AI generated (static prop)
- house: Poly Haven fallback (CC0)
```

### 3D Subagent

**Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:**

> You are implementing Step 1.5 (3D Assets) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: 3D (Three.js)
> **Skill to load**: `game-3d-assets` and `meshyai`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** at the project root before starting. It lists generated/downloaded models, character details, and any World Labs environment.
>
> **If a World Labs environment was generated** (check `progress.md` for `## 3D Environment` and files in `public/assets/environment/`):
> - Install SparkJS: `npm install @sparkjsdev/spark`
> - Load the SPZ (Gaussian Splat) via `SplatMesh` from `@sparkjsdev/spark` — add to scene like any Three.js mesh
> - **Y-flip required**: Apply `rotation.x = Math.PI` to BOTH the splat mesh and collider mesh (World Labs SPZ files are Y-inverted)
> - Compensate Z position after flip: `position.z += (minZ + maxZ)` based on collider bounding box
> - Load the collider mesh (GLB) as an invisible mesh for ground raycasting — characters walk on this
> - Call `colliderMesh.updateMatrixWorld(true)` after setting rotation/position (raycasts fail before first render otherwise)
> - Raycast UPWARD from Y=-50 with direction (0,1,0) to hit the floor after Y-flip
> - Keep last known ground height as fallback when raycast misses (collider gaps)
> - **Do NOT use the panorama** as `scene.background` — it causes a "world inside world" doubling effect. Use a solid color background instead.
> - Use a single `renderer.render(scene, camera)` call — SparkJS handles splats within the standard render pipeline
>
> **Rigged character GLBs + animation GLBs are already in** `public/assets/models/`. Set up the character controller:
>
> 1. Create `src/level/AssetLoader.js` — **CRITICAL: use `SkeletonUtils.clone()` for rigged models** (regular `.clone()` breaks skeleton bindings -> T-pose). Import from `three/addons/utils/SkeletonUtils.js`.
> 2. Add `MODELS` config to `Constants.js` with: `path` (rigged GLB), `walkPath`, `runPath`, `scale`, `rotationY` per model. **Start with `rotationY: Math.PI`** — most Meshy models face +Z and need flipping.
> 3. For each rigged model:
>    - Load with `loadAnimatedModel()`, create `AnimationMixer`
>    - Load walk/run animation GLBs separately, register their clips as mixer actions
>    - Log all clip names: `console.log('Clips:', clips.map(c => c.name))`
>    - Store mixer and actions in entity's `userData`
>    - Call `mixer.update(delta)` every frame
>    - Use `fadeToAction()` pattern for smooth transitions
> 4. For static models (ring, props): use `loadModel()` (regular clone)
> 5. **Orientation & scale verification (MANDATORY):**
>    - After loading each model, log its bounding box size
>    - Compute auto-scale to fit target height and container bounds
>    - Align feet to floor: `position.y = -box.min.y`
>    - **Characters must face each other / the correct direction** — adjust `rotationY` in Constants
>    - **Characters must fit inside their environment** (ring, arena, platform)
>    - Position characters close enough to interact (punch range, not across the arena)
> 6. Add primitive fallback in `.catch()` for every model load
>
> **After completing your work**, append a `## Step 1.5: 3D Assets` section to `progress.md` with: models used (Meshy-generated vs library), scale/orientation adjustments, verified facing directions.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After 3D subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

### After Step 1.5

**Tell the user (2D):**
> Your game now has pixel art sprites and backgrounds! Every character, enemy, item, and background tile has a distinct visual identity. Here's what was created:
> - `src/core/PixelRenderer.js` — rendering engine
> - `src/sprites/` — all sprite data, palettes, and background tiles

**Tell the user (3D):**
> Your game now has custom 3D models! Characters were generated with Meshy AI (or sourced from the model library), rigged, and animated with walk/run/idle. Props and scenery are loaded from GLB files. Here's what was created:
> - `src/level/AssetLoader.js` — model loader with SkeletonUtils
> - `public/assets/models/` — Meshy-generated and/or library GLB models
> - OrbitControls camera with WASD movement

> **Next up: visual polish.** I'll add particles, screen transitions, and juice effects. Ready?

Mark task 2 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Step 2: Design the Visuals

Mark task 3 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 2 (Visual Design — Spectacle-First) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Skill to load**: `game-designer`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** at the project root before starting. It describes the game's entities, events, constants, and what previous steps have done.
>
> Apply the game-designer skill with spectacle as the top priority. Work in this order:
>
> **1. Opening Moment (CRITICAL — this determines promo clip success):**
> - Entrance flash: `cameras.main.flash(300)` on scene start
> - Player slam-in: player starts off-screen, tweens in with `Bounce.easeOut`, landing shake (0.012) + particle burst (20 particles)
> - Ambient particles active from frame 1 (drifting motes, dust, sparkles)
> - Optional flavor text (e.g., "GO!", "DODGE!") — only when it naturally fits the game's vibe
> - Verify: the first 3 seconds have zero static frames
>
> **2. Every-Action Effects (wire to SPECTACLE_* events from Step 1):**
> - Particle burst (12-20 particles) on `SPECTACLE_ACTION` and `SPECTACLE_HIT`
> - Floating score text (28px, scale 1.8, `Elastic.easeOut`) on `SCORE_CHANGED`
> - Background pulse (additive blend, alpha 0.15) on `SCORE_CHANGED`
> - Persistent player trail (particle emitter following player, `blendMode: ADD`)
> - Screen shake (0.008-0.015) on hits
>
> **3. Combo & Streak System (wire to SPECTACLE_COMBO / SPECTACLE_STREAK):**
> - Combo counter text that scales with combo count (32px base, +4px per combo)
> - Streak milestone announcements at 5x, 10x, 25x (full-screen text slam + 40-particle burst)
> - Hit freeze frame (60ms physics pause) on destruction events
> - Shake intensity scales with combo (0.008 + combo * 0.002, capped at 0.025)
>
> **4. Standard Design Audit:**
> - Full 10-area audit (background, palette, animations, particles, transitions, typography, game feel, game over, character prominence, first impression / viral appeal)
> - **Every area must score 4 or higher** — improve any that fall below
> - First Impression / Viral Appeal is the most critical category
>
> **5. Intensity Calibration:**
> - Particle bursts: 12-30 per event (never fewer than 10)
> - Screen shake: 0.008 (light) to 0.025 (heavy)
> - Floating text: 28px minimum, starting scale 1.8
> - Flash overlays: alpha 0.3-0.5
> - All new values go in Constants.js, use EventBus for triggering effects
> - Don't alter gameplay mechanics
>
> **After completing your work**, append a `## Step 2: Design` section to `progress.md` with: improvements applied, new effects added, any color or layout changes.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

**Tell the user:**
> Your game looks much better now! Here's what changed: [summarize changes]
>
> **Next up: promo video.** I'll autonomously record a 50 FPS gameplay clip in mobile portrait — ready for social media. Then we'll add music and sound effects.

Mark task 3 as `completed`.

**Proceed directly to Step 2.5** — no user confirmation needed (promo video is non-destructive and fast).

---

## Step 2.5: Record Promo Video

Mark task 4 as `in_progress`.

**This step stays in the main thread.** It does not modify game code — it records autonomous gameplay footage using Playwright and converts it with FFmpeg. No QA verification needed.

**Pre-check: FFmpeg availability**

```bash
ffmpeg -version | head -1
```

If FFmpeg is not found, warn the user and skip this step:
> FFmpeg is not installed. Skipping promo video. Install it with `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or `apt install ffmpeg` (Linux), then run `/game-creator:promo-video` later.

Mark task 4 as `completed` and proceed to Step 3.

**Copy the conversion script** from the plugin:

```bash
cp <plugin-root>/skills/promo-video/scripts/convert-highfps.sh <project-dir>/scripts/
chmod +x <project-dir>/scripts/convert-highfps.sh
```

**Launch a `Task` subagent** to generate the game-specific capture script:

> You are implementing Step 2.5 (Promo Video) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Dev server port**: `<port>`
> **Skill to load**: `promo-video`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** and the following source files to understand the game:
> - `src/scenes/GameScene.js` — find the death/failure method(s) to patch out
> - `src/core/EventBus.js` — understand event flow
> - `src/core/Constants.js` — check input keys, game dimensions
> - `src/main.js` — verify `__GAME__` and `__GAME_STATE__` are exposed
>
> **Create `scripts/capture-promo.mjs`** following the `promo-video` skill template. You MUST adapt these game-specific parts:
>
> 1. **Death patching** — identify ALL code paths that lead to game over and monkey-patch them. Search for `triggerGameOver`, `gameOver`, `takeDamage`, `playerDied`, `onPlayerHit`, or any method that sets `gameState.gameOver = true`. Patch every one.
>
> 2. **Input sequence** — determine the actual input keys from the game's input handling (look for `createCursorKeys()`, `addKeys()`, `input.on('pointerdown')`, etc.). Generate a `generateInputSequence(totalMs)` function that produces natural-looking gameplay for this specific game type:
>    - **Dodger** (left/right): Alternating holds with variable timing, occasional double-taps
>    - **Platformer** (jump): Rhythmic taps with varying gaps
>    - **Shooter** (move + fire): Interleaved movement and fire inputs
>    - **Top-down** (WASD): Figure-eight or sweep patterns
>
> 3. **Entrance pause** — include a 1-2s pause at the start so the entrance animation plays (this is the visual hook).
>
> 4. **Viewport** — always `{ width: 1080, height: 1920 }` (9:16 mobile portrait) unless the game is desktop-only landscape.
>
> 5. **Duration** — 13s of game-time by default. For slower-paced games (puzzle, strategy), use 8-10s.
>
> **Config**: The script must accept `--port`, `--duration`, and `--output-dir` CLI args with sensible defaults.
>
> **Do NOT run the capture** — just create the script. The orchestrator runs it.

**After subagent returns**, run the capture and conversion from the main thread:

```bash
# Ensure output directory exists
mkdir -p <project-dir>/output

# Run capture (takes ~26s for 13s game-time at 0.5x)
node scripts/capture-promo.mjs --port <port>

# Convert to 50 FPS MP4
bash scripts/convert-highfps.sh output/promo-raw.webm output/promo.mp4 0.5
```

**Verify the output:**
1. Check `output/promo.mp4` exists and is non-empty
2. Verify duration is approximately `DESIRED_GAME_DURATION / 1000` seconds
3. Verify frame rate is 50 FPS

If capture fails (Playwright error, timeout, etc.), warn the user and skip — the promo video is a nice-to-have, not a blocker.

**Extract a thumbnail** for the user to preview:
```bash
ffmpeg -y -ss 5 -i output/promo.mp4 -frames:v 1 -update 1 output/promo-thumbnail.jpg
```

Read the thumbnail image and show it to the user.

**Tell the user:**
> Promo video recorded! 50 FPS, mobile portrait (1080x1920).
>
> **File**: `output/promo.mp4` ([duration]s, [size])
>
> This was captured autonomously — the game ran at 0.5x, recorded at 25 FPS, then FFmpeg sped it up to 50 FPS. Death was patched out so it shows continuous gameplay.
>
> **Next up: music and sound effects.** Ready?

Mark task 4 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

## Step 3: Add Audio

Mark task 5 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 3 (Audio) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Skill to load**: `game-audio`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** at the project root before starting. It describes the game's entities, events, constants, and what previous steps have done.
>
> Apply the game-audio skill:
> 1. Audit the game: read EventBus events, read all scenes
> 2. Create `src/audio/AudioManager.js` — AudioContext init, master gain, BGM sequencer play/stop
> 3. Create `src/audio/music.js` — BGM patterns as note arrays using the Web Audio step sequencer
> 4. Create `src/audio/sfx.js` — SFX using Web Audio API (OscillatorNode + GainNode + BiquadFilterNode)
> 5. Create `src/audio/AudioBridge.js` — wire EventBus events to audio
> 6. Add audio events to EventBus.js (including `AUDIO_TOGGLE_MUTE`)
> 7. Wire audio into main.js and all scenes
> 8. **Mute toggle**: Wire `AUDIO_TOGGLE_MUTE` to master gain. Add M key shortcut and a speaker icon UI button. See the game-audio skill "Mute Button" section for requirements and drawing code.
> 9. **No npm packages needed** — all audio uses the built-in Web Audio API
>
> **After completing your work**, append a `## Step 3: Audio` section to `progress.md` with: BGM patterns added, SFX event mappings, mute wiring confirmation.
>
> Do NOT run builds — the orchestrator handles verification.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol.

**Tell the user:**
> Your game now has music and sound effects! Click/tap once to activate audio, then you'll hear the music.
>
> **Next up: QA tests.** I'll add a persistent Playwright test suite so you can run `npm test` after future changes. Ready?

Mark task 5 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

---

## Step 3.5: Add QA Test Suite

Mark task 6 as `in_progress`.

Launch a `Task` subagent with these instructions:

> You are implementing Step 3.5 (QA Test Suite) of the game creation pipeline.
>
> **Project path**: `<project-dir>`
> **Engine**: `<2d|3d>`
> **Dev server port**: `<port>`
> **Skill to load**: `game-qa`
>
> **Read `progress.md`** at the project root before starting. It describes the game's entities, events, constants, scoring system, and what previous steps have done.
>
> Apply the game-qa skill to create a persistent test suite:
>
> 1. **Install Playwright** (if not already installed): `npm install -D @playwright/test` + `npx playwright install chromium`
> 2. **Create test fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/game-test.js`) — custom fixture that waits for game boot, provides `startPlaying()`, and exposes `render_game_to_text()`
> 3. **Create test helpers** (`tests/helpers/seed-random.js`) — Mulberry32 seeded PRNG for deterministic tests
> 4. **Create `tests/e2e/game.spec.js`** — core gameplay tests:
>    - Game boots and shows canvas
>    - Scenes load correctly
>    - Player input works (test actual input keys from the game)
>    - Scoring increments
>    - Game over triggers
>    - Restart resets state cleanly
>    - `render_game_to_text()` returns valid JSON
>    - `advanceTime(ms)` resolves correctly
> 5. **Create `tests/e2e/visual.spec.js`** — visual regression tests:
>    - Initial gameplay screenshot (use 3000 maxDiffPixels tolerance for animated content)
>    - Game over state screenshot
> 6. **Create `tests/e2e/perf.spec.js`** — performance benchmarks:
>    - Load time < 5s
>    - FPS > 5 (headless Chromium reports low FPS; threshold is intentionally low)
>    - Canvas dimensions match Constants.js
> 7. **Create `playwright.config.js`** with `webServer` pointing to `npm run dev` on the correct port
> 8. **Add npm scripts** to `package.json`:
>    ```json
>    {
>      "scripts": {
>        "test": "npx playwright test",
>        "test:headed": "npx playwright test --headed"
>      }
>    }
>    ```
> 9. **Run tests** to generate baseline screenshots and verify all pass
> 10. **Fix any failing tests** — adjust selectors, timeouts, or thresholds as needed
>
> **After completing your work**, append a `## Step 3.5: QA Tests` section to `progress.md` with: test count, pass/fail results, baseline screenshots location.
>
> Do NOT modify game code — only add test infrastructure.

**After subagent returns**, verify tests pass:

```bash
cd <project-dir> && npm test
```

If tests fail, fix test code (not game code) — adjust timeouts, selectors, or tolerances. The game was already verified in previous steps.

**Tell the user:**
> Your game now has a persistent test suite! Run `npm test` any time to verify everything works.
>
> **Tests added:**
> - `tests/e2e/game.spec.js` — gameplay verification (boot, input, scoring, restart)
> - `tests/e2e/visual.spec.js` — visual regression with baseline screenshots
> - `tests/e2e/perf.spec.js` — load time, FPS, canvas dimensions
>
> **Next up: deploy to the web.** I'll publish your game to here.now for an instant public URL. Ready?

Mark task 6 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**
