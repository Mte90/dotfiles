# Make Game (Full Pipeline)

Build a complete browser game from scratch, step by step. This command walks you through the entire pipeline — from an empty folder to a deployed, monetized game. No game development experience needed.

**What you'll get:**
1. A fully scaffolded game project with clean architecture (delta capping, object pooling, resource disposal)
2. Pixel art sprites — recognizable characters, enemies, and items (optional, replaces geometric shapes)
3. Photorealistic 3D environments via World Labs Gaussian Splats (3D games, when `WLT_API_KEY` is set)
4. Visual polish — gradients, particles, transitions, juice
5. A 50 FPS promo video — autonomous gameplay capture, mobile portrait, ready for social media
6. Chiptune music and retro sound effects (no audio files needed)
7. A persistent Playwright test suite — run `npm test` after future changes
8. Live deployment to here.now with an instant public URL
9. Monetization via Play.fun — points tracking, leaderboards, wallet connect, and a play.fun URL to share on Moltbook
10. A quality score and review report
11. Redeploy with a single command (`npm run deploy`)

**Quality assurance is built into every step** — each code-modifying step runs build verification, visual review via Playwright MCP, and autofixes any issues found.

## Reference Files

- **[verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md)** — QA subagent instructions, autofix subagent instructions, visual review details, and the orchestrator flow for the verification loop.
- **[step-details.md](step-details.md)** — Detailed Step 1-5 subagent prompt templates, infrastructure setup instructions, character library checks, and per-step user messaging.
- **[tweet-pipeline.md](tweet-pipeline.md)** — Tweet-to-game pipeline: fetching and parsing tweets, creative abstraction, celebrity detection, and Meshy API key prerequisites.

## Performance Notes

- Take your time with each step. Quality is more important than speed.
- Do not skip validation steps — they catch issues early.
- Read the full context of each file before making changes.
- Every step must pass build + visual review before proceeding.

## Orchestration Model

**You are an orchestrator. You do NOT write game code directly.** Your job is to:

1. Set up the project (template copy, npm install, dev server)
2. Create and track pipeline tasks using `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`
3. Delegate each code-writing step to a `Task` subagent
4. Run the Verification Protocol (build + visual review + autofix) after each code-modifying step
5. Report results to the user between steps

**What stays in the main thread:**
- Step 0: Parse arguments, create todo list
- Step 1 (infrastructure only): Copy template, npm install, playwright install, start dev server
- Verification protocol orchestration (launch QA subagent, read text result, launch autofix if needed)
- Step 4 (deploy): Interactive auth requires user back-and-forth
- Step 5.5 (review): Read-only analysis, no code changes

**What goes to subagents** (via `Task` tool):
- Step 1 (game implementation): Transform template into the actual game concept
- Step 1.5: Pixel art sprites and backgrounds (2D) or World Labs environments + Meshy AI models (3D)
- Step 2: Visual polish
- Step 2.5: Promo video capture
- Step 3: Audio integration
- Step 3.5: QA test suite (Playwright)

Each subagent receives: step instructions, relevant skill name, project path, engine type, dev server port, and game concept description.

## Verification Protocol

Run after every code-modifying step (Steps 1, 1.5, 2, 3). Step 3.5 runs its own test verification. Delegates all QA work to a subagent to minimize main-thread context usage.

See [verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md) for full QA subagent instructions, orchestrator flow, and autofix logic.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Initialize pipeline

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the game concept. Arguments can take two forms:

#### Form A: Direct specification
- **Engine**: `2d` (Phaser — side-scrollers, platformers, arcade) or `3d` (Three.js — first-person, third-person, open world). If not specified, ask the user.
- **Name**: The game name in kebab-case. If not specified, ask the user what kind of game they want and suggest a name.

#### 3D API Keys

For 3D games, check for these API keys — first in `.env` (`test -f .env && grep -q '^KEY_NAME=.' .env`), then in the environment:
- **`MESHY_API_KEY`** — for generating custom 3D character/prop models with Meshy AI (see [tweet-pipeline.md](tweet-pipeline.md) for the prompt flow)
- **`WLT_API_KEY`** / **`WORLDLABS_API_KEY`** — for generating photorealistic 3D environments with World Labs Gaussian Splats. If not set, ask the user alongside `MESHY_API_KEY`:
  > I can also generate a **photorealistic 3D environment** with World Labs. Paste your key like: `WORLDLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here` — or type "skip" to use basic geometry.
  > (Keys are saved to .env and redacted from this conversation automatically.)

#### Form B: Tweet URL as game concept

See [tweet-pipeline.md](tweet-pipeline.md) for the full tweet fetching, parsing, creative abstraction, celebrity detection, and Meshy API key flow.

Create all pipeline tasks upfront using `TaskCreate`:

1. Scaffold game from template
2. Add assets: pixel art sprites (2D) or World Labs environments + Meshy AI-generated GLB models + animated characters (3D)
3. Add visual polish (particles, transitions, juice)
4. Record promo video (autonomous 50 FPS capture)
5. Add audio (BGM + SFX)
6. Add QA test suite (Playwright — gameplay, visual, perf)
7. Deploy to here.now
8. Monetize with Play.fun (register on OpenGameProtocol, add SDK, redeploy)

This gives the user full visibility into pipeline progress at all times. Quality assurance (build, runtime, visual review, autofix) is built into each step, not a separate task.

After creating tasks, create the `output/` directory in the project root and initialize `output/autofix-history.json` as an empty array `[]`. This file tracks all autofix attempts across the pipeline so fix subagents avoid repeating failed approaches.

### Step 1: Scaffold the game

Mark task 1 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 1 infrastructure setup, subagent prompt template, progress.md creation, and user messaging.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol (see [verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md)).

Mark task 1 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 1.5: Add game assets

**Always run this step for both 2D and 3D games.** 2D games get pixel art sprites; 3D games get GLB models and animated characters.

Mark task 2 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 1.5 character library check, tiered fallback, 2D subagent prompt, 3D asset flow, 3D subagent prompt, and user messaging.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol (see [verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md)).

Mark task 2 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 2: Design the visuals

Mark task 3 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 2 subagent prompt template (spectacle-first design, opening moment, combo system, design audit, intensity calibration) and user messaging.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol (see [verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md)).

Mark task 3 as `completed`.

**Proceed directly to Step 2.5** — no user confirmation needed (promo video is non-destructive and fast).

### Step 2.5: Record promo video

Mark task 4 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 2.5 promo video capture flow: FFmpeg check, capture script subagent, capture execution, conversion, thumbnail extraction, and user messaging.

Mark task 4 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Add audio

Mark task 5 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 3 subagent prompt template (AudioManager, BGM, SFX, AudioBridge, mute toggle) and user messaging.

**After subagent returns**, run the Verification Protocol (see [verification-protocol.md](verification-protocol.md)).

Mark task 5 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 3.5: Add QA test suite

Mark task 6 as `in_progress`.

See [step-details.md](step-details.md) for the full Step 3.5 subagent prompt template (Playwright install, test fixtures, game/visual/perf specs, npm scripts).

**After subagent returns**, run `npm test` to verify all tests pass. Fix test code (not game code) if needed.

Mark task 6 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 4: Deploy to here.now

Mark task 7 as `in_progress`.

**This step stays in the main thread** because it may require user back-and-forth for API key setup.

#### 7a. Check prerequisites

Verify the here-now skill is installed:

```bash
ls ~/.agents/skills/here-now/scripts/publish.sh
```

**If not found**, tell the user:
> The here-now skill is needed for deployment. Install it with:
> ```
> npx skills add heredotnow/skill --skill here-now -g -y
> ```
> Tell me when you're ready.

**Wait for the user to confirm.**

#### 7b. Build the game

```bash
npm run build
```

Verify `dist/` exists and contains `index.html` and assets. If the build fails, fix the errors before proceeding.

#### 7c. Verify the Vite base path

Read `vite.config.js`. For here.now, the `base` should be `'/'` (the default). If it's set to something else (e.g., a GitHub Pages subdirectory path), update it:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/',
  // ... rest of config
});
```

Rebuild after changing the base path.

#### 7d. Publish to here.now

```bash
~/.agents/skills/here-now/scripts/publish.sh dist/
```

The script outputs the live URL immediately (e.g., `https://<slug>.here.now/`).

Read and follow `publish_result.*` lines from script stderr. Save the slug for future updates.

**If anonymous (no API key):** The publish expires in **24 hours and will be permanently deleted** unless the user claims it. The script returns a claim URL. **You MUST immediately tell the user:**

> **ACTION REQUIRED — your game will be deleted in 24 hours!**
> Visit your claim URL to create a free here.now account and keep your game online permanently.
> The claim token is only shown once and cannot be recovered. Do this now before you forget!

Then proceed to 7e to help them set up permanent hosting.

**If authenticated:** The publish is permanent. Skip 7e.

#### 7e. Set up permanent hosting

**This step is strongly recommended for anonymous publishes.** Help the user create a here.now account so their game stays online:

1. Ask for their email
2. Send magic link:
   ```bash
   curl -sS https://here.now/api/auth/login -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
   ```
3. Tell the user: "Check your inbox for a sign-in link from here.now. Click it, then copy your API key from the dashboard."
4. Save the key:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.herenow && echo "<API_KEY>" > ~/.herenow/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.herenow/credentials
   ```
5. Re-publish to make it permanent:
   ```bash
   ~/.agents/skills/here-now/scripts/publish.sh dist/ --slug <slug>
   ```

#### 7f. Verify the deployment

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://<slug>.here.now/"
```

Should return 200 immediately (here.now deploys are instant).

#### 7g. Add deploy script

Add a `deploy` script to `package.json` so future deploys are one command:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && ~/.agents/skills/here-now/scripts/publish.sh dist/"
  }
}
```

**Tell the user (if authenticated):**
> Your game is live!
>
> **URL**: `https://<slug>.here.now/`
>
> **Redeploy after changes**: Just run:
> ```
> npm run deploy
> ```
> Or if you're working with me, I'll rebuild and redeploy for you.
>
> **Next up: monetization.** I'll register your game on Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol), add the points SDK, and redeploy. Players earn rewards, you get a play.fun URL to share on Moltbook. Ready?

**Tell the user (if anonymous — no API key):**
> Your game is live!
>
> **URL**: `https://<slug>.here.now/`
>
> **IMPORTANT: Your game will be deleted in 24 hours unless you claim it!**
> Visit your claim URL to create a free here.now account and keep your game online forever.
> The claim token is only shown once — save it now!
>
> **Redeploy after changes**: Just run:
> ```
> npm run deploy
> ```
>
> **Next up: monetization.** I'll register your game on Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol), add the points SDK, and redeploy. Players earn rewards, you get a play.fun URL to share on Moltbook. Ready?

> For advanced deployment options (GitHub Pages, custom domains, troubleshooting), load the `game-deploy` skill.

Mark task 7 as `completed`.

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 5: Monetize with Play.fun

Mark task 8 as `in_progress`.

**This step stays in the main thread** because it requires interactive authentication.

#### 8a. Authenticate with Play.fun

Check if the user already has Play.fun credentials. The auth script is bundled with the plugin:

```bash
node skills/playdotfun/scripts/playfun-auth.js status
```

**If credentials exist**, skip to 8b.

**If no credentials**, start the auth callback server:

```bash
node skills/playdotfun/scripts/playfun-auth.js callback &
```

Tell the user:

> To register your game on Play.fun, you need to log in once.
> Open this URL in your browser:
> **https://app.play.fun/skills-auth?callback=http://localhost:9876/callback**
>
> Log in with your Play.fun account. Credentials are saved locally.
> Tell me when you're done.

**Wait for user confirmation.** Then verify with `playfun-auth.js status`.

If callback fails, offer manual method as fallback.

#### 8b. Register the game on Play.fun

Determine the deployed game URL from Step 6 (e.g., `https://<slug>.here.now/` or `https://<username>.github.io/<game-name>/`).

Read `package.json` for the game name and description. Read `src/core/Constants.js` to determine reasonable anti-cheat limits based on the scoring system.

Use the Play.fun API to register the game. Load the `playdotfun` skill for API reference. Register via `POST https://api.play.fun/games`:

```json
{
  "name": "<game-name>",
  "description": "<game-description>",
  "gameUrl": "<deployed-url>",
  "platform": "web",
  "isHTMLGame": true,
  "iframable": true,
  "maxScorePerSession": "<based on game scoring>",
  "maxSessionsPerDay": 50,
  "maxCumulativePointsPerDay": "<reasonable daily cap>"
}
```

**Anti-cheat guidelines:**
- Casual clicker/idle: `maxScorePerSession: 100-500`
- Skill-based arcade (flappy bird, runners): `maxScorePerSession: 500-2000`
- Competitive/complex: `maxScorePerSession: 1000-5000`

Save the returned **game UUID**.

#### 8c. Add the Play.fun Browser SDK

First, extract the user's API key from stored credentials:

```bash
# Read API key from agent config (stored by playfun-auth.js)
# Example path for Claude Code — adapt for your agent
API_KEY=$(cat ~/.claude.json | jq -r '.mcpServers["play-fun"].headers["x-api-key"]')
echo "User API Key: $API_KEY"
```

If no API key is found, prompt the user to authenticate first.

Then add the SDK script and meta tag to `index.html` before `</head>`, substituting the actual API key:

```html
<meta name="x-ogp-key" content="<USER_API_KEY>" />
<script src="https://sdk.play.fun/latest"></script>
```

**Important**: The `x-ogp-key` meta tag must contain the **user's Play.fun API key** (not the game ID). Do NOT leave the placeholder — always substitute the actual key extracted above.

Create `src/playfun.js` that wires the game's EventBus to Play.fun points tracking:

```js
// src/playfun.js — Play.fun (OpenGameProtocol) integration
import { eventBus, Events } from './core/EventBus.js';

const GAME_ID = '<game-uuid>';
let sdk = null;
let initialized = false;

export async function initPlayFun() {
  const SDKClass = typeof PlayFunSDK !== 'undefined' ? PlayFunSDK
    : typeof OpenGameSDK !== 'undefined' ? OpenGameSDK : null;
  if (!SDKClass) {
    console.warn('Play.fun SDK not loaded');
    return;
  }
  sdk = new SDKClass({ gameId: GAME_ID, ui: { usePointsWidget: true } });
  await sdk.init();
  initialized = true;

  // addPoints() — call frequently during gameplay to buffer points locally (non-blocking)
  eventBus.on(Events.SCORE_CHANGED, ({ score, delta }) => {
    if (initialized && delta > 0) sdk.addPoints(delta);
  });

  // savePoints() — ONLY call at natural break points (game over, level complete)
  // WARNING: savePoints() opens a BLOCKING MODAL — never call during active gameplay!
  eventBus.on(Events.GAME_OVER, () => { if (initialized) sdk.savePoints(); });

  // Save on page unload (browser handles this gracefully)
  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => { if (initialized) sdk.savePoints(); });
}
```

**Critical SDK behavior:**

| Method | When to use | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `addPoints(n)` | During gameplay | Buffers points locally, non-blocking |
| `savePoints()` | Game over / level end | **Opens blocking modal**, syncs buffered points to server |

Do NOT call `savePoints()` on a timer or during active gameplay — it interrupts the player with a modal dialog. Only call at natural pause points (game over, level transitions, menu screens).

**Read the actual EventBus.js** to find the correct event names and payload shapes. Adapt accordingly.

Add `initPlayFun()` to `src/main.js`:

```js
import { initPlayFun } from './playfun.js';
// After game init
initPlayFun().catch(err => console.warn('Play.fun init failed:', err));
```

#### 8d. Rebuild and redeploy

```bash
cd <project-dir> && npm run build && ~/.agents/skills/here-now/scripts/publish.sh dist/
```

If the project was deployed to GitHub Pages instead, use `npx gh-pages -d dist`.

Verify the deployment is live (here.now deploys are instant; GitHub Pages may take 1-2 minutes).

#### 8e. Tell the user

> Your game is monetized on Play.fun!
>
> **Play**: `<game-url>`
> **Play.fun**: `https://play.fun/games/<game-uuid>`
>
> The Play.fun widget is now live — players see points, leaderboard, and wallet connect.
> Points are buffered during gameplay and saved on game over.
>
> **Share on Moltbook**: Post your game URL to [moltbook.com](https://www.moltbook.com/) — 770K+ agents ready to play and upvote.

Mark task 8 as `completed`.

### Step 5.5: Code Review (informational)

After monetization, run a final quality review. This is read-only — no code changes, no pipeline blocking.

Load the `review-game` skill and run the full analysis against the project directory. Report the scores and any recommendations to the user:

> **Quality Report:**
> - Architecture: X/5
> - Performance: X/5
> - Code Quality: X/5
> - Monetization Readiness: X/5
>
> **Recommendations** (if any):
> - [list any issues found]
>
> These are suggestions for future improvement — your game is already live and monetized!

## Example Usage

### 2D game from prompt
```
/make-game 2d flappy-cat
```
Result: Scaffold → pixel art cat + pipe sprites → sky gradient + particles → chiptune BGM + meow SFX → promo video → deploy to here.now → register on Play.fun. ~10 minutes, playable at `https://flappy-cat.here.now/`.

### 3D game from tweet
```
/make-game https://x.com/user/status/123456
```
Result: Fetches tweet → abstracts game concept → 3D Three.js scaffold → Meshy AI character models → visual polish → audio → deploy + monetize.

### Pipeline Complete!

Tell the user:

> Your game has been through the full pipeline! Here's what you have:
> - **Scaffolded architecture** — clean, modular code with delta capping, object pooling, and resource disposal
> - **Pixel art sprites** — recognizable characters (if chosen) or clean geometric shapes
> - **3D environments** — photorealistic Gaussian Splat worlds (3D games with World Labs)
> - **Visual polish** — gradients, particles, transitions, juice
> - **Promo video** — 50 FPS gameplay footage in mobile portrait (`output/promo.mp4`)
> - **Music and SFX** — chiptune background music and retro sound effects
> - **Test suite** — run `npm test` for gameplay, visual regression, and performance checks
> - **Quality assured** — each step verified with build, runtime, and visual review
> - **Live on the web** — deployed to here.now with an instant public URL
> - **Monetized on Play.fun** — points tracking, leaderboards, and wallet connect
> - **Quality score** — architecture, performance, and code quality review
>
> **Share your play.fun URL on Moltbook** to reach 770K+ agents on the agent internet.
> **Post your promo video** to TikTok, Reels, or X to drive traffic.
>
> **What's next?**
> - Add new gameplay features: `/game-creator:add-feature [describe what you want]`
> - Upgrade to pixel art (if using shapes): `/game-creator:add-assets`
> - Re-record promo video: `/game-creator:record-promo`
> - Run a deeper code review: `/game-creator:review-game`
> - Launch a playcoin for your game (token rewards for players)
> - Keep iterating! Run any step again: `/game-creator:design-game`, `/game-creator:add-audio`
> - Redeploy after changes: `npm run deploy`
> - Run tests after changes: `npm test`
> - Switch to GitHub Pages if you prefer git-based deploys: `/game-creator:game-deploy`
