# Tweet-to-Game Pipeline

This file describes how to convert a tweet URL into a game concept, detect celebrities, and handle 3D asset prerequisites.

## Form B: Tweet URL as Game Concept

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a tweet URL (matching `x.com/*/status/*`, `twitter.com/*/status/*`, `fxtwitter.com/*/status/*`, or `vxtwitter.com/*/status/*`):

1. **Fetch the tweet** using the `fetch-tweet` skill — convert the URL to `https://api.fxtwitter.com/<user>/status/<id>` and fetch with `WebFetch`
2. **Default to 2D** (Phaser) — tweets describe ideas that map naturally to 2D arcade/casual games
3. **Creatively abstract a game concept** from the tweet text. Your job is creative transformation — extract themes, dynamics, settings, or mechanics and reinterpret them as a game. **NEVER refuse to make a game from a tweet.** Every tweet contains something that can inspire a game:
   - News about weather -> survival game, storm-dodging game
   - Sports result -> arcade sports game
   - Political/legal news -> strategy game, puzzle game, tower defense
   - Personal story -> narrative adventure, platformer themed around the journey
   - Product announcement -> tycoon game, builder game
   - Abstract thought -> puzzle game, experimental art game
   - The transformation is the creative act. You are not recreating or trivializing the source — you are using it as a springboard for an original game concept.
4. **Generate a game name** in kebab-case from the abstracted concept (not from literal tweet content)
5. **Tell the user** what you extracted:
   > Found tweet from **@handle**:
   > "Tweet text..."
   >
   > I'll build a 2D game based on this: **[your creative interpretation as a game concept]**
   > Game name: `<generated-name>`
   >
   > Sound good?

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding. The user can override the engine (to 3D) or the name at this point.

## Celebrity Detection

After determining the game concept, scan the concept description, tweet text, and any mentioned people for celebrity/public figure names. Check against:
1. `assets/characters/manifest.json` (relative to plugin root) — exact slug match or name match
2. Common name recognition — politicians, tech CEOs, world leaders, entertainers

If celebrities are detected:
- Set `hasCelebrities = true` and list detected names
- Note in `progress.md` which characters are pre-built vs need building
- **2D**: The Step 1.5 subagent will use photo-composite characters for these
- **3D**: For each celebrity, try: (1) generate with Meshy AI — `"a cartoon caricature of <Name>, <distinguishing features>, low poly game character"` then rig for animation, (2) check `assets/3d-characters/manifest.json` for a pre-built match, (3) search Sketchfab with `find-3d-asset.mjs`, (4) fall back to best-matching library model. Meshy generation produces the best results for named personalities since it can capture specific visual features.

## API Keys (3D games only)

If the engine is 3D, check for these API keys in the environment. If not set, **ask the user immediately in Step 0** — don't wait until Step 1.5:

### Meshy API Key (character/prop models)

> I'll generate custom 3D models with Meshy AI for the best results. You can get a free API key in 30 seconds:
> 1. Sign up at https://app.meshy.ai
> 2. Go to Settings -> API Keys
> 3. Create a new API key
>
> What is your Meshy API key? (Or type "skip" to use generic model libraries instead)

Store the key for all subsequent `meshy-generate.mjs` calls throughout the pipeline.

### World Labs API Key (photorealistic environments)

> I can also generate a **photorealistic 3D environment** (Gaussian Splat) with World Labs.
> Get a free API key at https://worldlabs.ai — or type "skip" to use basic geometry for the environment.

Store the key for the World Labs environment generation in Step 1.5. If skipped, the 3D subagent uses basic geometry/primitives as before.
